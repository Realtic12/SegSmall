# SegSmall

SegSmall is a project that aims to reduce the computation cost of semantic segmentation models, allowing them to run efficiently on low-power GPU devices. By optimizing the model architecture and training process, SegSmall is able to achieve high-quality segmentation results while significantly reducing the computational resources required. This makes the technique viable for deployment on edge devices, such as mobile phones or embedded systems, where power and resource constraints are important considerations.

## Setup

To use the implementation, you would need to use a virtual environment and install the necessary packages.
We recommend using Anaconda for this:

```bash
    conda create -n <environment_name> python=3.11
    conda activate <environment_name>
    pip install -r requeriments.txt
```

Make sure to use Python 3.11 when creating the virtual environment. This version of Python is required for the project to function correctly.
Once you've set up the environment, you should be ready to start using the SegSmall implementation.
